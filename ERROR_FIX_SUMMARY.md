# Fatal Error Fix - Cannot Redeclare Method

## Error Description
```
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare TPAK_DQ_Admin_Menu::enqueue_admin_scripts() in 
/home/dqtpak/domains/dq.tpak.or.th/public_html/new/wp-content/plugins/tpak-dq-system/admin/class-admin-menu.php on line 965
```

## Root Cause
The `TPAK_DQ_Admin_Menu` class had two `enqueue_admin_scripts()` method definitions:

1. **First method** (around line 200): The original method that was already working
2. **Second method** (around line 965): A duplicate method that was accidentally added during the JavaScript fixes

## Fix Applied
Removed the duplicate `enqueue_admin_scripts()` method at the end of the `admin/class-admin-menu.php` file.

### Before Fix:
```php
// ... existing method around line 200 ...
public function enqueue_admin_scripts($hook) {
    // Original implementation
}

// ... other methods ...

// DUPLICATE METHOD (REMOVED)
public function enqueue_admin_scripts($hook) {
    // Duplicate implementation causing the error
}
```

### After Fix:
```php
// ... existing method around line 200 ...
public function enqueue_admin_scripts($hook) {
    // Original implementation (kept)
}

// ... other methods ...
// Duplicate method removed
```

## Files Modified
- `admin/class-admin-menu.php` - Removed duplicate method definition

## Verification
The fix can be verified by:

1. **No Fatal Error**: The website should load without the "Cannot redeclare" error
2. **Class Instantiation**: The `TPAK_DQ_Admin_Menu` class should instantiate successfully
3. **Method Exists**: The `enqueue_admin_scripts` method should still exist and work properly
4. **Scripts Load**: Admin scripts should still load correctly on TPAK DQ pages

## Test Files
- `test_error_fix.php` - Comprehensive test to verify the error is resolved

## Expected Results After Fix
- ✅ Website loads without fatal errors
- ✅ TPAK DQ System admin pages work correctly
- ✅ JavaScript and CSS files load properly
- ✅ AJAX functionality works as expected
- ✅ Status change functionality remains intact

## Note
This error was caused by accidentally adding a duplicate method during the JavaScript console error fixes. The original `enqueue_admin_scripts` method was already properly implemented and working correctly.
